# WHAT IS THIS?

Suppose you're like me

- Tier 4 College
- Good in Programming and coding Web Apps
- Understands Performance, Tooling, System Designs
- Highly appreciated in office for your work

But not good at Data Structures and Algorithms Problems that are required to get into top tech.

Don't worry I have figured out that in our college there was almost no emphasis on Data Structures and Algorithms that's why our base is weak.

So the path I am following

1. Learn from the free lectures that are available on the internet each topic.
2. Practice/Solve the easy problems that are shown in the lectures.
3. Solve the different types of problems from the Blind's List.
4. Learn by doing the code
