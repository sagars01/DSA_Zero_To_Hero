# WHAT IS THIS?

Suppose you're like me

- Tier 4 College
- Good in Programming and coding Web Apps
- Understands Performance, Tooling, System Designs
- Highly appreciated in office for your work

But not good at Data Structures and Algorithms Problems that are required to get into top tech.

Don't worry I have figured out that in our college we had almost no idea what was DSA and how to solve those problems.

So the path I am following

1. Learn from the lectures that are available on the internet each topic.
2. Solve the easy problems that are shown in the lectures.
3. Solve the different types of problems from the Blinds List.
