# WHAT IS THIS?

Suppose you're like me

- Tier 4 College
- Good in Programming and coding Web Apps
- Understands Performance, Tooling, System Designs
- Highly appreciated in office for your work

But not good at Data Structures and Algorithms Problems that are required to get into top tech.

Don't worry I have figured out that in our college we had almost no idea what was DSA and how to solve those problems.
