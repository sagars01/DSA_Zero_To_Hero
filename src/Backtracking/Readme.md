# BACKTRACKING

### Why

Backtracking is pretty important concept to solve many algorithmic questions. The problem that you might encounter is the **WORD SEARCH PROBLEM** from [LC-79](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-search/)

Here are couple of important resources that I recommend before you start with your backtracking journey:

## VIDEO RESOURCES

1. Abdul Bari Sir's Videos
   a. [Introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKCbsiDBN6c)
   b. [N-Queens-Problem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFv_Hl4B83A) - this will bring the intuition of Space Trees and how to visualize a problem
2. Kevin's Code Implementation of [Word-Search-Problme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYYNp0Jrdv0) - this will help you design the coding pattern for these problems.

After setting up the basic understanding then you might want to start solving this list below.

1. Letter Combinations of a Phone Number
2. Generate Parentheses
3. Permutations
4. Permutations II
5. Combinations
6. Subsets
7. Subsets II
8. N-Queens

The code for these problems are there in the current directory. Once, you are comfortable with all these problems. I believe you can tackle any problem related to backtracking in the future.

I hope you find the content useful.
