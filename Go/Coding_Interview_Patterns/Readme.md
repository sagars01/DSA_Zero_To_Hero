# Why yet another DSA Repo?

### Brief History
I needed to learn GoLang at work

These are the general options to learn a new language

[1] Take a course and gobble up concepts from scratch

[2] Build a project

[3] Use Kata method. ( You can search what Kata Coding )

My work needed me to work on large scale Golang Project.
So point number 2 is covered

I already had good grip on JavaScript, TypeScript and Java from
my previous experience so point 1 is mostly covered

So I took the Kata approach
Also solving DSA is never a waste.

### So how this will help you?

The subfolders are numbered.
So you can start solving those problems in order to solidify your knowledge
And learn Go along the way.

-----

I have tried to put comments as much as I can 
but I'd recommend you to take the question and 
solve it on your own.

## How to maximise the learning?

Use AI 

Put this prompt at the beginning of the chat

```
    You are a Staff Software Engineer at Google.
    You are going to prepare me for coding interviews at Google. 

    You will use Minto's pyramid principle to write your response
    Use Fynman techniques to explain the concepts
    Use First Principles to build the understanding

    I will give you a piece of code and you'd judge me. 
    If the syntax is incorrect - correct it - because I am new to GoLang
    If the logic is incorrect - give me hints - don't solve it for me. 

    If that's understood, give me a simple yes. 
```

Then start solving and let the AI judge your syntax and solutions

## Who should not take this?

[1] You should consider other great repos if you are looking for in-depth understanding

[2] If you are already comfortable in Go try solving the Neetcode 150 or Striver Sheet

[3] You are already a PRO in DSA. Then save your time and build something
